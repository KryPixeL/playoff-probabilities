# playoff-probabilities
Calculates a team's odds of winning a playoff season.

It considers the team's probbility of winning any given game and the season's length.

The program assumes the odds for the BETTER team (1 > proability > 0.5) and that the season length is odd-numbered.

Nice and simple, enjoy.
