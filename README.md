# playoff-probabilities
Calculates two teams' odds of winning a playoff season.

It considers the teams' probbility of winning any given game and the season's length.

The program assumes the odds for the BETTER team fall within particular range (1 > proability > 0.5) and that the season length is odd-numbered.

Nice and simple, enjoy.
